## Generating MagpyLib Test Data

The `python/generate_test_magpy/magnets` module contains the `generate_test` function that will create CSVs of test data, consisting of *magnet.csv*, *magnet-small.csv*, *magnet-translate.csv*, *magnet-rotate.csv*, *magnet-rotate-translate.csv*, substituting *magnet* with the name of the class. Each file contains magnetic field vectors of a test magnet at 1,000 (10x10x10) observer points. The magnets' rotation is `[π/7, π/6, π/5]` in rotation vector form, and parameters are in sync with the Rust side. For magnet position, `(0.03, 0.02, 0.01)` is used for *magnet-small.csv*, otherwise, `(0.1, 0.2, 0.3)` is used. The other magnet parameters are similarly scaled down by 10, e.g., a magnet with polarization vector magnitude of 1 Tesla will correspond to a small magnet of 0.1 Tesla.

The observer points are generated using `get_points` and `get_points_small` functions located in `python/test_generation_util` module. The observer points are spaced evenly, spanning from -0.05 to +0.05 in each axis for *small magnets* and from -0.5 to +0.05 *non-small magnets* As mentioned above, each axis consists of 10 data points, forming a grid of 1,000 observer points.

*magnet.csv* and *magnet-small.csv* tests the field function without translating or rotating the magnet. *magnet-translate.csv* translates the magnet by `[-0.1, -0.2, -0.3]`, and *magnet-rotate.csv* rotates the magnet by the inverse of `[π/7, π/6, π/5]` to cancel out the magnet's orientation, while *magnet-rotate-translate.csv* performs both operations. This approach allows for a consistent setup for testing the functionality of magnet position and orientation, translation, rotation, and field function.
